# Randomizer
Inspired by every day's problem of deciding what to prepare for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner etc. We just cook whatever comes randomly from a list of food approved by my wife :p 

https://agrawalshyam67.github.io/Randomizer/

This can be useful for every household (especially Indian) when we want to eat something but don't know what to eat and reply with "Kuch bhi" (Meaning: "Anything") Currently it only shows vegetarian indian dishes which is possible to cook in Germany

This side project can be further extended with list of food items showing up, differentiating between Type of food (Veg, Non Veg, Vegan etc) and more. :)
